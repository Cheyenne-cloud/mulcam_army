Anyways, I can tell that she is blink too now. Hahahhaa ahh she is so cute when she dance to blackpink song.

Some people really need to chill, my niece is 3 years old who has her own preference, hope u all can respect that (her fav: DDD, Boombayah, KTL). and ofcourse I like all of bp songs.

Just a disclaimer NOT ALL BLINKS WERE REAL BLINKS specially those who throw hate to others kpop groups/fandoms. So WE THE REAL BLINKS want to apologize on the behalf of the immature blonks. 

We waited for soooo long just to support our girls comeback so we’re not here to hate or start a war.

"@Himanshu Pandey using emojies doesn’t freeze the views. however writing vi3ws and str3am makes u look even more suspicious, and they might think u are a bot.","32"
" @Himanshu Pandey  Views are not frozen because of comments, emojis or specific words. YouTube freezes views while it checks if the views are real. If there are a lot of views it takes time.Apr 11, 2019To make sure that all views are validated, as view count goes higher, they update less frequently and might occasionally freeze above 300 views to assure quality view count. This is the normal operation in YouTube videos. ... YouTube has, apparently, grown tired of answering those questions.YouTube can detect when a video appears to be getting views from bots, but technically they do not know for sure. ... While you can buy views from bots, you can also ""buy"" views from people, which is usually done by advertising your video in some way. This is perfectly legal and will not get you in trouble.","38"

"I hate that people are fighting over this... I’m army and blink so I don’t like the 2 fandoms fighting. Or anybody fighting over a long waited song. And it’s not just army’s or blinks it’s random people who have never listened to KPOP and just want something to bother people about. Haters are gonna be haters but the fan wars... what’s the point??? KPOP idols get along perfectly fine so why can’t we.","8.1만"

"the ones that are writing the same comments know more than BLINKS that BLACKPINK are a BOOM n they step at EVERYONE , they know pretty well how LALISA MANOBAN'S rap is killing them inside , how KIM JENNIE'S beauty n facial expression is destroying the KOREAN BEAUTY STANDARDS , how KIM JISOO's vocals n charisma is adding lot of things to the mv and HOW PARK ROSE is killing em with her unique vocal , with the way EVERY hairstyle suits her ;) that's a fact. Im not underestimating any group cuz im a multistan n proud of every group that KPOP holds. so comment whatever u want to comment , n fr3eeze the vi3ws. Its doesn't matter. Blackpink had already destroyed charts n u know that haters. thanks for passing by here anyway. YO PINKS ARE TRENDING !! LETS CELEBRATE BLIIINKSSSS !

Edit: i just couldn't reply to the one she told me she loves me , i love u too blink ! n for the one that are saying we are celebrating  fake news then why are u giving us a free view ? leave us writing negative comments ISNT the solution bro , if u dont like my comment just go or dislike it i dont care , i just wanted to shut up the hate in the comment section , we didnt hate on your group just do the same let people success. Also i want to say that i love BLACKPINK members equally , if what i wrote about jennie looks less than the other members remember that the love we have for her is more than words. love u BLINKS!","4.5만"

"ATTENTION BLINKS!

Please don't forget to vote blackpink in choeaedol app. If you don't have the app please download it.
•Type in recommender: choose only 1
-HYLT world domination
-lookatmenowlookatyou
-ot4blackpinkblink

• BLINKS! don’t forget to save your hearts for HOT TIME (20:00 - 23:30 KST). it's better to vote near the end of HOT TIME, so our competitors won't have time to catch up.

• Always vote on community posts instead of giving hearts to blackpink directly! when you vote more than 100 hearts on community posts, you and the writer will receive 10% of votes as a reward.

• You can also create your own community posts and use your hearts on them; if you vote with more than 100 hearts on your own post you will win 20% as the reward

• You can get 5 mystery heart boxes every four hours by clicking on other posts in the community (prizes can range from 7 hearts to 1000 hearts)

• Check out the heart refill station which gives you easy ways to earn hearts every day! 

• Make sure you are mainly using your daily hearts! only use ever hearts if necessary, we are saving our ever hearts for the big day. Don't waste them!

Thank you so much!","3"

I posted a whole paragraph listing all the things I liked in this comeback but it got no likes and comments and it got lost because of all the stupid spamming. Infact I was liking and commenting on all the good relevant comments to bring them up. So what if I am not a blink. I support people regardless. Hating someone for no reason at all is stupid. So I just hope that you guys don't think we are doing this. This comeback is great. I hope you enjoy this dear blinks. Your girls and you deserved this.","4.9천"

• Always vote on community posts instead of giving hearts to blackpink directly! when you vote more than 100 hearts on community posts, you and the writer will receive 10% of votes as a reward.

• You can also create your own community posts and use your hearts on them; if you vote with more than 100 hearts on your own post you will win 20% as the reward

• You can get 5 mystery heart boxes every four hours by clicking on other posts in the community (prizes can range from 7 hearts to 1000 hearts)

• Check out the heart refill station which gives you easy ways to earn hearts every day! 

• Make sure you are mainly using your daily hearts! only use ever hearts if necessary, we are saving our ever hearts for the big day. Don't waste them!

also why is everyone commenting the same thing-

1st edit:
some y'all need to chill with the ""no emoji""

2nd edit:
so now this ""<3"" is an emoji, no hearts in this comment anymore(aside from that heart lol)

3rd edit:
thanks to the person that told me that emojis don't freeze the views, lol adding the emojis back in :) 
don't @ me if you're telling me to remove it, i won't, just focus on streaming rather than telling people ""no emoji"" ""remove emoji freezes views""

4th edit:
guys stop telling me to delete the emojis because it ""freezes"" the views because literally the emojis don't youtube freezes the views to check if they're real views or just bots. please stop, some of you guys are really nice about it which i appreciate, but i won't delete the emojis, as long as you just keep streaming the views are there :)
you guys can even search up ""do emojis freeze views"" it will tell you it doesn't

"Blinks please stream how you like that for the song of the year and vote for blackpink at mama awards. 
For those who do not know to vote;
you have to download the mwave app and vote using 10 different accounts. You have to vote for blackpink at the following categories,
Artist of the year
Song of the year 
Worldwide Fanchoice 
Best female group
Best female dance group 
PLEASE BLINKS STREAM THIS MV AND VOTE FOR BLACKPINK. We have to do this for our queens.
I not sure whether this is true if not some please correct me,
I think as most blinks are not being able to download the app, u can try this method to vote for blackpink 
1. Search in Google for MAMA 2020 vote and visit the wesite.
2. Sign in before voting.
3. Select the categories you want to vote for blackpink ( remember that blackpink is nominated in 5 categories so vote for all 5 categories).
4. Select blackpink to vote
5. Then click OK button
6. After selecting blackpink for all nominated categories you want to vote, Click on the VOTING COMPLETE button to submit your vote.
7. you have to enter the code these send you and the Submit.
8. Then you will get the message that you voting is complete.
Blinks PLEASE VOTE USING 10 DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS and vote using not just one device but many if possible.
MAKE SURE TO VOTE FOR BLACKPINK EVERYDAY.
STREAM HOW YOU LIKE THAT 
When voting using the app follow the same steps I have mentioned in the second method except for 1st method.
Blinks it's time to show that what a huge fandom we are and to show that we will not let our queens get down.
If u can please share this message with everyone.
I really hope u would spend some minute on these girls by voting as they have spent so many years making us happy and surprised by their every performance.
This is a chance given to us blinks so show how much as a fandom we make our 4 gorgeous queens happy.

"An anti, her account name is ""Jennie Kim Official"" a fake blink, she or he just opened his account few days ago and is commenting bad things about other artists included twice and bts saying BP is better and other they are flop... Etc It literally proves that he or she is an army and once or other fan wanting BP and blink to get hated.... ""Spread this message if you see other accounts like this"" Haha haters wait blinks gotta cut you into hundred pieces 😘 
And it's a trick played by haters , pretending to be a fan but is a hater and saying bad things about other idols because they want the celebraties they hate to get hated..

"I have something to say as a Vietnamese Blink ;) 
I don't know if Blinks and Armies anywhere around the world are related, but that's not the case in Vietnam. Vietnamese Blinks and Armies are each others' worst enemies and they will always find some way to worsen their rivals. (Except for fans of both groups lol) Perhaps that is why so many Blinks thought that Armies wrote those bullsht comments! I hope that we can understand each other more, stop the fanwars and kill those antis ;)","34"

Edit: aww I'm glad that you guys agree! But I also want to mention the others:

Lisa's rap part: like she just came in like that, and I just believe they wrote the rap just for her! Becuase you can clearly see that it's totally her style and flow (also did anyone get boombayah vibes?). And that black hair.

Jennie slayed as usual. Love that she's still going strong even with all those haters who are trying to bring her down! Look at her now all you solo stans and antis. I especially love her ""how you like that""

Jisoo was just UGH a literally QUEEN. I've always secretly thought that a lot of Jisoo's hair didn't do her justice but this time it was literally perfect. Her voice in the pre chorus was just gorgeous I seriously love her voice yall.","178"

"Honestly I've never really paid much attention to BlackPink. A lot of people judge them too much cause like the toxic talk going on from ARMYs and BLINKs as well. Since I'm an ARMY (but not a reallllllllllllllly big one cause I'm more a STAY) I hear lots of toxic from both sides. But BLINKs, don't listen to them, you should be proud of who you're representing cause this song really caught my attention and others as well. Blackpink's DDU DU played on my school's news for the intro. To me that's amazing. I think it was the 2018-2019 year. My friend hates kpop but I always hear her singing this non-stop and so am I. Blackpink is amazing and new people should never listen to whatever haters are saying because we should never let drama hurt the people who created this masterpiece.

"Blinks please str@am how you like that for the song of the year and vote for blackpink at mama awards. 
For those who do not know to vote;
you have to download the mwave app and vote using 10 different accounts. You have to vote for blackpink at the following categories,
Artist of the year
Song of the year 
Worldwide Fanchoice 
Best female group
Best female dance group 
PLEASE BLINKS STR@AM THIS MV AND VOTE FOR BLACKPINK. We have to do this for our queens.
I not sure whether this is true if not some please correct me,
I think as most blinks are not being able to download the app, u can try this method to vote for blackpink 
1. Search in Google for MAMA 2020 vote and visit the wesite.
2. Sign in before voting.
3. Select the categories you want to vote for blackpink ( remember that blackpink is nominated in 5 categories so vote for all 5 categories).
4. Select blackpink to vote
5. Then click OK button
6. After selecting blackpink for all nominated categories you want to vote, Click on the VOTING COMPLETE button to submit your vote.
7. you have to enter the code these send you and the Submit.
8. Then you will get the message that you voting is complete.
Blinks PLEASE VOTE USING 10 DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS and vote using not just one device but many if possible.
MAKE SURE TO VOTE FOR BLACKPINK EVERYDAY.
STR@AM HOW YOU LIKE THAT 
When voting using the app follow the same steps I have mentioned in the second method except for 1st method.
Blinks it's time to show that what a huge fandom we are and to show that we will not let our queens get down.
If u can please share this message with everyone.
I really hope u would spend some minute on these girls by voting as they have spent so many years making us happy and surprised by their every performance.
This is a chance given to us blinks so show how much as a fandom we make our 4 gorgeous queens happy.

"ATTENTION BLINKS!

Please don't forget to vote blackpink in choeaedol app. If you don't have the app please download it, my recommender is HYLT world domination.


• BLINKS! don’t forget to save your hearts for HOT TIME (20:00 - 23:30 KST). it's better to vote near the end of HOT TIME, so our competitors won't have time to catch up.

• Always vote on community posts instead of giving hearts to blackpink directly! when you vote more than 100 hearts on community posts, you and the writer will receive 10% of votes as a reward.

• You can also create your own community posts and use your hearts on them; if you vote with more than 100 hearts on your own post you will win 20% as the reward

• You can get 5 mystery heart boxes every four hours by clicking on other posts in the community (prizes can range from 7 hearts to 1000 hearts)

• Check out the heart refill station which gives you easy ways to earn hearts every day! 

• Make sure you are mainly using your daily hearts! only use ever hearts if necessary, we are saving our ever hearts for the big day. Don't waste them!

Thank you so much! 💕💕","6"

Sorry bu needed to get this out of my chest and i want people to see this. Like im so sick of lisas rap and this is definitely not a hate towards her but JENNIE is the MAIN RAPPER GOD! F U YG!

" @Veronica.  i think SOTY has like 4 ppl who could get it. Psycho by RV, HYLT for blackpink, Dynamite for BTS, and HIP for MAMAMOO (Actually when ppl where saying ''vote on mama'' i thought they meant vote mamamoo somewhere) but rn it looks like its leaning towards HYLT and Psycho, dynamite is a very good song dont get me wrong, but i honestly think their korean songs have the superiority.","5"

"Blinks please str@am how you like that for the song of the year and vote for blackpink at mama awards. 
For those who do not know to vote;
you have to download the mwave app and vote using 10 different accounts. You have to vote for blackpink at the following categories,
Artist of the year
Song of the year 
Worldwide Fanchoice 
Best female group
Best female dance group 
PLEASE BLINKS STR@AM THIS MV AND VOTE FOR BLACKPINK. We have to do this for our queens.
I not sure whether this is true if not some please correct me,
I think as most blinks are not being able to download the app, u can try this method to vote for blackpink 
1. Search in Google for MAMA 2020 vote and visit the wesite.
2. Sign in before voting.
3. Select the categories you want to vote for blackpink ( remember that blackpink is nominated in 5 categories so vote for all 5 categories).
4. Select blackpink to vote
5. Then click OK button
6. After selecting blackpink for all nominated categories you want to vote, Click on the VOTING COMPLETE button to submit your vote.
7. you have to enter the code these send you and the Submit.
8. Then you will get the message that you voting is complete.
Blinks PLEASE VOTE USING 10 DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS and vote using not just one device but many if possible.
MAKE SURE TO VOTE FOR BLACKPINK EVERYDAY.
STRE@M HOW YOU LIKE THAT 
When voting using the app follow the same steps I have mentioned in the second method except for 1st method.
Blinks it's time to show that what a huge fandom we are and to show that we will not let our queens get down.
If u can please share this message with everyone.
I really hope u would spend some minute on these girls by voting as they have spent so many years making us happy and surprised by their every performance.
This is a chance given to us blinks so show how much as a fandom we make our 4 gorgeous queens happy.
