"Their vocal is pre-recorded, so this performance is half lip sync + half pre-recorded vocal, you can see different in mic, aespa are using ""Band-Aid"" mic, the mic is always provided by broadcasting company as it's cheap, and it's quality is very low. if sing live, singer will use black microphone or big black microphone, you can check IZ*ONE Fiesta Inkigayo 20200301 ~ IZ*ONE Fiesta performance at Inkigayo 20200301, half lip sync + half live ~" "0"

"Might the stylist not understand their model shapes and the stage background. The designs do not work well on the girls except Karina. Her body is in the best shape and white dress helps her a lot, other members arenot that lucky. Too colorful background, dancers in black and Aespa cant take the spotlight. Hope the stylist makes it better next time" "3"

" @Khusus YT  yeah thts what fourth gen gotta do btw. U know sm style and yg are different. Yg never playing with that concept theory and sm yeah. Since exo thou. So yeah their concept is different but both group slay with their own identity" "3"
"Both groups are great. But they don't have the same vibe, concept-wise and vocal-wise. 

Blackpink's badass concepts give off the obvious, somewhat chaotic vibe reminiscent of their seniors Big Bang and 2ne1. Aespa has more versatile concepts, and even their badass concepts exude seamless elegance (another classic SM trademark no matter the concept is for any SM artist/group). 

Aespa is a vocal powerhouse. (Consistent great quality of singing is personally my top priority when stanning a kpop artist or group.)

Even the rapping, Blackpink has the classic strong, in-your-face quality while Aespa's rapping is more of the subdued type, but the flow is remarkable nonetheless. 

Blackpink is already a senior group while Aespa is still a rookie group so comparing them is somewhat unfair lol but yeah, they are both amazing." "12"
